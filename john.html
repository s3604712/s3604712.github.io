        <p dir="ltr"><strong>My interest with IT stems from the love of using technology. I have always loved using different types of technology, working out how they work, how they interact with each other and what goes into making this technology work. My interest with IT started from a young age, my first IT event that I remember was building my first desktop computer. I remember trying to work out what each part was, what it did and where it went on the motherboard. Last summer I completed an internship at Telstra within their IT department. I worked on many different projects but the most complicated one was a managed cloud platform. I worked with many different teams (some local and some international) and met many different people in many different roles.</strong><strong></strong></p>
