        <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
        https://www.seek.com.au/job/36934024?type=standard
<p></p>
This is a Business Analyst role within a Cyber Security department. This will include looking at all the end to end processes and identifying any business processes that have no been included or finding a way to improve the current processes. This appeals to me as one, it is a job that I have already had experience within during my internship, two, I think I can apply what I have learnt from my studies into this job, and three, it is quite a large salary. 
<p></p>
The skills that are required for the job are: You need to be able to identify business needs, be able to define behaviour models, be able to model business domains, work in an agile environment and also maintain a strong relationship with your stakeholders. The experience needed for the job is at least 5 years of another business analyst role with understandings of security topics such as cyber security and information security.
<p></p>
I currently have some analysis skills that I have developed through my studies and also through my job experiences. I am able to work within an agile environment as I have done this before. I have strong team/communication skills as many of my previous experiences have required these. I also have strong leadership skills which assist in an analyst role as much of their work is trying to organise teams and taking charge of projects. I currently have no qualifications but hopefully I will in 4 months time!
