My interest in IT began when I was quite young, when I would have IT class in school or playing computer games with my older brothers. In addition, when teachers had problems with their computer, often I would be the one that was able to troubleshoot and fix the issue.</strong></p>
          <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-736e68e8-7fff-bb46-e1f8-bc552d69f70b">A person that sparked my interest in IT, was my dad who was a very tech-savvy person. Whenever I had issues with my computer, he was always able to fix it and as a result, it had me very intrigued with what he did and how he did it. It was from there, that I began to troubleshoot my own problems and play around with technology. I have not necessarily worked in an IT based job, but at this current moment I am exploring my options to see what there is to offer.</strong></p>
