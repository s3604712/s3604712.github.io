        <h4 style="color:red;">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h4> <p></p>
My interest with IT stems from the love of using technology. I have always loved using different types of technology, working out how they work, how they interact with each other and what goes into making this technology work. My interest with IT started from a young age, my first IT event that I remember was building my first desktop computer. I remember trying to work out what each part was, what it did and where it went on the motherboard. Last summer I completed an internship at Telstra within their IT department. I worked on many different projects but the most complicated one was a managed cloud platform. I worked with many different teams (some local and some international) and met many different people in many different roles.

        <h4 style="color:red;">Why did you choose to come to RMIT</h4>
        <p></p>
        I chose RMIT for a few different reasons, firstly, from speaking to career councilors at high school they told me that RMIT had one of the best Business/Information Systems degrees available, so already I was interested. Secondly, RMIT has a lot of industry contacts, so coming from RMIT is already an advantage as they know that the standard of teaching is high. And Thirdly, its location in the middle of the CBD is hard to pass up, its so easy to get to which means it attracts a wide variety of people.
        <p></p>
        <h4 style="color:red;">What did you expect to learn during your studies</h4>
        <p></p>
        This may be a bit bias now since I am in my final semester, however, what I expected to learn was very different to what I actually learnt. Coming into university doing an information systems degree I expected it to be a lot more of a hands on technology course, however, this degree has taught me more of the design aspects that go into the building of different systems and how to analyse these systems. I think this was more beneficial for me as it can be applied to all different departments not just IT.
