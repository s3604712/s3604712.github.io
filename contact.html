        <h1>Myki Smartphone App</h1>
        <p></p>
My project idea is developing an smartphone app in conjunction with Myki that will deliver a platform for customers to quickly and easy top up and monitor their myki cards from their phone. Currently myki does not have an app that allows you to do this and their website can take up to 24 hours for top ups to go through. Through the app you will be able to monitor multiple cards at once, top up your myki instantly, deactivate cards and also using the NFC features of current smartphones tap on to the myki readers just as you would with a credit card etc.
<p></p>
This project would be extremely useful to everyday commuters as it would create a system that can be used from anywhere. There is approximately 16 Million smartphone users in Australia and over 5 million just in Victoria. Victoria is one of the only states in Australia that currently does not have a public transport application that users can use on their smartphone. Imagine, rush hour at one of Melbourne’s busiest train stations, and you just realise you don’t have any money left on your Myki, what do you do? Wait at one of their top up machines for 20 minutes and miss your train? No, just use your smartphone app and do it instantly.
<p></p>
The app would need to have cooperation with Myki so that any technical features that would need to be added can be added correctly. Firstly, there would be a prototype of the application built for both iOS and Android which would include all features such as Auto top up, instant top up and activation/reactivation of cards. Then after this prototype is designed and developed this is where the cooperation with Myki would need to happen. We would need Myki to give us permission to access their card details and allow us to transfer money onto these cards instantly, instead of the 24 hours you currently have to wait. If the cooperation goes ahead then we would also continue to receive their help to code our mobile phones to be able to give off the same frequencies as their cards	 would to their card readers. It would most likely be easier to update their card readers to accept the NFC of current smartphones however. 

The skills that would be required would be a high end software developer, this is because not only does the app need to have functionality, but it also has to have integration with Myki’s systems. Another important skill that is needed is also a good user experience designer, this is also very important as the functionality is only as good as how the user is able to access this functionality. The design has to allow for all types of users (some that are not as technically advanced as others may be). It would be quite feasible to find these skills that are required as the app would benefit a large percentage of Victorian’s. There is always a time when you need to catch public transport and this app would just make this experience better. 
<p></p>
If the project is successful it will impact millions of Victorians instantly, the outcome would include a purpose built application that would allow people the ease of topping up their Myki’s from wherever they are, would also allow people the security of knowing if they forget their myki or they lose it they would be able to cancel it straight away or still be able to touch onto their chosen form of transport with their phone. This would hopefully also solve a large problem for Myki which is fare evading. There would no longer be an excuse to fare evade as you can always 1) keep track of how much money is on your myki, 2) if you are running low on money, you can instantly top it up and 3) forgetting your myki would no longer be an excuse as you will always be able to have your myki on you.

So this is my IT Project Idea.
